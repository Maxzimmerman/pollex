Configurable Cache System

The cache system lets you declare datasets in your config. Each dataset will start its own supervised GenServer, which fetches data from a configured source (such as an Ecto Repo) and keeps it cached in memory. It implements Nebulex to get even more options including runntime options

# config/config.exs

```elixir
config :pollex, Pollex.Application,
    datasets: %{
        cities: %{
        refresh_interval_seconds: 6,
        cache: {NebulexCacheAdapter, [columns: [:name]]},
        source: {EctoSourceAdapter, [table: Pollex.City, repo: Pollex.Repo]},
        cache_runtime_opts: [
            gc_interval: :timer.hours(12),
            max_size: 1_000_000,
            allocated_memory: 2_000_000_000,
            gc_cleanup_min_timeout: :timer.seconds(10),
            gc_cleanup_max_timeout: :timer.minutes(10)
        ]
    }
}
```

refresh_interval_seconds â†’ how often the cache refreshes
source â†’ defines the data source (table + repo)
cache â†’ defines how the data is stored in the GenServer (e.g., which columns to fetch)
and other runntime options used by nebulex

# Lookup

Once the cache is running, you can fetch data at any time

```elixir
iex> NebulexCache.lookup(:cities)
iex>
%{
"australia" => "australia",
"austria" => "austria",
"azerbaijan" => "azerbaijan",
"germany" => "germany",
"russia" => "russia",
"united kingdom" => "united kingdom",
"usa" => "usa"
}
```
