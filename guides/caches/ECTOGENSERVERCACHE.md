Configurable Cache System

The cache system lets you declare datasets in your config. Each dataset will start its own supervised GenServer, which fetches data from a configured source (such as an Ecto Repo) and keeps it cached in memory.

There are also some introduction videos showing how to use this package

# config/config.exs

```elixir
config :pollex, Pollex.Application,
  datasets: %{
    cities: %{
      refresh_interval_seconds: 6,
      cache: {GenServerCacheAdapter, [columns: [:name]]},
      source: {EctoSourceAdapter, [table: Pollex.City, repo: Pollex.Repo]}
    }
  }
```

refresh_interval_seconds â†’ how often the cache refreshes
source â†’ defines the data source (table + repo)
cache â†’ defines how the data is stored in the GenServer (e.g., which columns to fetch)

# Lookup

Once the cache is running, you can fetch data at any time

```elixir
iex> EctoGenServerCache.lookup(:cities)
[
  %{name: "germany"},
  %{name: "usa"},
  %{name: "australia"},
  %{name: "united kingdom"},
  %{name: "austria"}
]
```
